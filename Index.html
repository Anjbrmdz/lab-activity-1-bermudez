    <h1>Fix You</h1>
    <h4>Song by Cold Play</h4>
    <h5>Lyrics</h5>
    <p>
      When you try your best, but you don't succeed <br />
      When you get what you want, but not what you need <br />
      When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep <br />
      Stuck in reverse <br />
      <br />
      And the tears come streaming down your face <br />
      When you lose something you can't replace <br />
      When you love someone, but it goes to waste <br />
      Could it be worse? <br />
      <br />
      Lights will guide you home <br />And ignite your bones <br />
      And I will try to fix you <br />
      <br />
      And high up above, or down below <br />When you're too in love to let it
      go <br />But if you never try, you'll never know <br />
      Just what you're worth <br />
      <br />Lights will guide you home <br />And ignite your bones <br />And I
      will try to fix you <br />
      <br />
      Tears stream down your face <br />
      When you lose something you cannot replace <br />Tears stream down your
      face, and I <br /><br />Tears stream down your face <br />
      I promise you I will learn from my mistakes <br />

      Tears stream down your face, and I <br />
      <br />Lights will guide you home <br />
      And ignite your bones <br />
      And I will try to fix you
    </p>
